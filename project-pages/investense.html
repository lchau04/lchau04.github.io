                <h3>Brief</h3>
                <p>INVESTENSE, initially sparked by my interest in the revamped 2024 FAFSA. Diversed from that path and highlights the gap in financial education among college students. Recognizing the critical role of financial literacy in effective money management for students, the project aimed to develop a user-centered solution. I focused on designing an intuitive and informative platform providing users with essential financial knowledge and tools, as well as the ability to simulate investing with real world data.</p>

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>I aimed to gather a diverse range of responses to gain a comprehensive understanding of the services my platform will offer. To achieve this, I utilized a combination of research methods, including both qualitative and quantitative approaches. From conducting interviews, organizing card sorting activities, and distributing surveys.</p>

                    <p>• The topic of most interest was investing with 29/41 respondents being interested, followed by credit and loans.</p>
                    <p>• Respondents generally feel less informed about the different types of financial resources available to them when they were college students, with most rating themselves as 2 or 3 out of 5. With no respondents choosing 5</p>
                    <p>• Many respondents have some college or an associate's degree, and a significant portion are students. With a few already being graduated or unemployed</p>

                    <p>The aim of this card sorting exercise was to gain insights into how individuals categorize various financial terms they encounter during financial discussions, learning, or comprehension.</p>
                    <p>By examining the categorization tendencies of individuals with varying levels of financial knowledge, I can better tailor my platform to address their preferences and prioritize specific subject areas within the realm of finance.</p>

                    <p>This was my first time going through the whole UX design process and it is evident that the platform requires further development and refinement, focusing on its content, interactions, and minor user interface elements to enhance the user experience. </p>
                    <p>Looking ahead, I will make sure to have a better understanding of the problem statement I want to design for as well as the UX elements to implement to reach that goal.</p>
                    <p>In terms of this project, the primary focus will be to tailor the platform to better serve college students, addressing their diverse academic needs. As, during the development I felt the platform stranded away from its initial intentions. Additionally, there's a need to revamp the simulation page, making it more accessible and user-friendly for newcomers. Exploring various methods to integrate simulations effectively into the platform will also be a key area of development.</p>
