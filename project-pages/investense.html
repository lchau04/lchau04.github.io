                <h3>Brief</h3>
                <p>INVESTENSE, initially sparked by my interest in the revamped 2024 FAFSA. Diversed from that path and highlights the gap in financial education among college students. Recognizing the critical role of financial literacy in effective money management for students, the project aimed to develop a user-centered solution. I focused on designing an intuitive and informative platform providing users with essential financial knowledge and tools, as well as the ability to simulate investing with real world data.</p>

                <p>I aimed to gather a diverse range of responses to gain a comprehensive understanding of the services my platform will offer. To achieve this, I utilized a combination of research methods, including both qualitative and quantitative approaches. From conducting interviews, organizing card sorting activities, and distributing surveys.</p>

                    <p>• The topic of most interest was investing with 29/41 respondents being interested, followed by credit and loans.</p>
                    <p>• Respondents generally feel less informed about the different types of financial resources available to them when they were college students, with most rating themselves as 2 or 3 out of 5. With no respondents choosing 5</p>
                    <p>• Many respondents have some college or an associate's degree, and a significant portion are students. With a few already being graduated or unemployed</p>

                    <p>The aim of this card sorting exercise was to gain insights into how individuals categorize various financial terms they encounter during financial discussions, learning, or comprehension.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>By examining the categorization tendencies of individuals with varying levels of financial knowledge, I can better tailor my platform to address their preferences and prioritize specific subject areas within the realm of finance.</p>

                    <h3>Card Sort Findings</h3>
                    <p>• RothIRAs and 401(k) were always grouped together as well as Scholarships/grants and FASFA</p>
                    <p>• participants usually made four to six different categories</p>
                    <p>• Many individuals were confused on terms like diversification, bonds, and FHA</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>I focused on uncovering the complex relationship between financial well-being and the college experience in order to understand not only the financial aspects of participants' lives but also their underlying emotions and attitudes.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The insights gathered from these interviews helped me develop a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges, concerns, and aspirations of individuals in managing their finances while pursuing higher education; and will assist in shaping features and solutions that cater to the platform I plan on developing.</p>
